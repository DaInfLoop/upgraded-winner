Journal Entry #2 (08/07/2023)
Haroon

Journal Entry #2, date is the 8th of July 2023.

Got a working build ready. Now I need to find a suitable test subject.
Could try use a friend's. Actually no, that'd be too destructive.

I need to sandbox this. I've now realized if not contained properly this can corrupt loads of data.
I'll take a rest for now and try upload some working code to my profile tomorrow.
